## Project Overview

This Android studio-based project is a quiz entertainment application that enables users the ability to take quiz sets, or make their own quiz sets as required.

The data is persisted in a Firebase Realtime Database and is integrated with a REST API to get the user manual when the user requests it.

- Language: Kotlin
- Minimum SDK:  API 24: Android Studio Iguana

## Github and Github Actions 

For the API. The code is pushed to Github, then we set up workflows using Github Workflow Actions, and integration with Azure Web App services to host the REST API.
The rest api is hosted and live on Azure and a CD/CI pipeline has been set up between the Github repo and the Azure Web App Host service. 

For the code of the app. The code will be pushed to Github and we will set up Github workflows to test the code integrity. 

Use these prompts in chat to write your report to add to the read me file. Speak about why Github and Github Actions was the preferred option and the benefits of using Azure to host.
